## Features 

### Existing Features

- __Navigation Menu__

* Located where the user expects this kind of element to be located, i.e. in the top of the page.
* Same colors and same general appearance all over the pages.
* Responsive.
* Gives the users a clue about where they are in the site.

- __The Landing Page__

With a beautiful picture of the Cobh colored houses, this page is inviting the user to come to Cobh, in its main section.

There is a message saying "Come to Cobh" (hero-message) in a positioned div that has an absolute position and is a child of a positioned div that has a relative position and has that picture of the colored houses (hero-image) as its background image. So the hero-message is positioned relative to the hero-image and it is positioned outside of the boundaries of that image, to draw the attention of the user.
