        Main Section 

        This is the main-walks section. It contains a walks-outer 
        element that contains all the walk elements.

        Each walk element represents a piece of walk. The set of walk
        elements here in this page represents the whole tour.

        Each walk element is composed of a heading, a walk-text and 
        two images.

                <div class="walk-text">This is a very quick stroll. If you get in Cobh by train, the promenade is a good
                    starting point for your journey. From the promenade, you can go everywhere in Cobh and you can
                    always come back there for a coffee or just rest and enjoy the view over the Cork Harbour.</div>

                <div class="walk-text">Walking up the steep streets of Cobh, you can get a little tired, but the way
                    will never be too long.
                    When you arrive the cathedral you will find it is worth it. The view over the Cork Harbour is
                    amazing. You need to go there and check this out.
